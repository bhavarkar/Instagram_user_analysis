Instagram User Analytics

Description:
User analysis is the process by which we track how users engage and interact with our digital product (software or mobile application) in an attempt to derive business insights for marketing, product & development teams.
These insights are then used by teams across the business to launch a new marketing campaign, decide on features to build for an app, track the success of the app by measuring user engagement and improve the experience altogether while helping the business grow.
You are working with the product team on Instagram and the product manager has asked you to provide insights on the questions asked by the management team.

B) Investor Metrics: Our investors want to know if Instagram is performing well and is not becoming redundant like Facebook, they want to assess the app on the following grounds

User Engagement: Are users still as active and post on Instagram or they are making fewer posts
Your Task: Provide how many times does average user posts on Instagram. Also, provide the total number of photos on Instagram/total number of users
Solution 

SELECT (SELECT Count(*) 
        FROM   photos) / (SELECT Count(*) 
                          FROM   users) AS avg; 
    
 
                             avg

2  Bots & Fake Accounts: The investors want to know if the platform is crowded with fake and dummy accounts
Task: Provide data on users (bots) who have liked every single photo on the site (since any normal user would not be able to do this).

FROM   users 
       INNER JOIN likes 
               ON users.id = likes.user_id 
GROUP  BY likes.user_id 
HAVING num_likes = (SELECT Count(*) 
                    FROM   photos);
